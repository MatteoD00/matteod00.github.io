# About me...
I am a MSc student in Physics at University of Turin, specialising in silicon detectors for high energy physics experiments. Iâ€™m also a tech passionate and a (basic) programmer.

# Academic experience
- *BSc Degree in Physics* - _University of Turin_ (2019 - 2022)
  - Thesis: "Characterization and data analysis on resistive silicon detectors"
  - Grade: 108/110
- *MSc Degree in Physics* - _University of Turin_ (2022 - ongoing)<br>
  I'm specializing in various aspects of experimental particle physics (simulation, event reconstruction and analysis, detector characterisation, electronics). My main focus is about R&D of silicon detectors with improved time resolution and radiation tolerance for future collider experiments.

# Working experience 
- *Math and Science tutor* - _University of Turin_ (01/2021 - 06/2021)<br>
  Tutor for the project "Compiti@Casa" (translation: Homework@Home).
  Helping student from middle school in maths and science in order to achieve more independence while studying and doing homework at home. 
  Focus on the problems and gaps related to e-learning during COVID-19 pandemic.
- *Laboratory assistant* - _University of Turin_ (03/2024 - 04/2024)<br>
  Laboratory assistant for the course "Introduction to Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics" of the BSc Degree in Physics.
  The main activity was to help the students of the laboratory with the experiences about SiPM and scintillators for cosmic rays detection.
- *Summer Reasearch Student* - _DESY Hamburg_ (07/2024 - 09/2024)<br>
  Working in the ATLAS ITk Strip End-Cap division, with a focus on Petal & System Test.
  Main activity related to the operation of a monitoring and interlock system based on a Arduino micro-controller for a coldbox setup.
  Worked on both the electronical and coding aspects of the project.
